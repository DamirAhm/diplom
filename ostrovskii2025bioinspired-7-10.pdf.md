Class 1 excitable neurons encode input strength smoothly by mod-
ulating  the  frequency  of  their  spiking  output.  In  contrast,  class  2
excitable neurons may act as threshold elements, signaling when input
strength exceeds a certain value. Both properties play essential roles
in neural computations. Biological neurons exhibiting class 3 excitable
behavior are often referred to as ‘‘unhealthy’’, as they demonstrate it
after prolonged adverse exposure.

For classes 1 and 2, a drop in frequency is visible in Fig. 6(b) and
(c) when a certain current value passes. This behavior is not typical
for  biological  neurons.  Since  the  frequency  is  expected  to  increase
along with the current, we assume that the current operating range
must be limited to the value corresponding to the peak frequency. This
restriction should also help to avoid the excitation block.

While respecting current limits, control of the 𝐸𝑇𝐷 voltage allows
flexible frequency modulation, which is clearly shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
As one can see from Fig. 8, when a bio-like input signal is applied,
namely a pink noise-shaped current, the shape of the response signal,
produced by the artificial neuron, also looks bio-plausible. Changing
the excitability class explicitly affects the number of generated spikes,

all other conditions being equal.

3.2.  Operating modes

The effect of external stimuli on the spiking modes of a deterministic
neuron model is studied using parametric diagrams. In the numerical
simulation, the current signal parameters 𝑓𝑒𝑥𝑡 and 𝑎𝑒𝑥𝑡 of Eq. (6) are
varied, as can be seen in Fig. 9. Interpeak intervals (IPI) are chosen
as an indicative feature for the single-parameter orbit diagrams. In the
two-parameter diagrams, the periodicity of dynamical modes and the
largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) are color-coded.

The diagrams shown in Fig. 9 demonstrate regions of regular and
chaotic behavior. The emergence of chaotic dynamics is observed in a
wide range of the sinusoidal current component’s amplitude 𝑎𝑒𝑥𝑡 when
the frequency 𝑓𝑒𝑥𝑡 exceeds 700 Hz.

Let us consider regions belonging to different excitability classes on
the parameter planes of a deterministic neuron model. Fig. 10 shows
high-resolution parametric diagrams for neuron models with GI401A
and GI403A backward diodes.

For comparison, in Fig. 11 we present diagrams for neuron models
with BD5 and BD4 backward diodes. Thus, one can trace the difference
for similar tunnel diodes with slightly different peak currents 𝐼𝑝.

The parameters selected for the study are modulatory voltage 𝐸𝑇𝐷 vs
capacitance 𝐶, and modulatory voltage 𝐸𝑇𝐷 vs tuning voltage 𝐸𝑉 𝑀 . The
first parameter plane diagram is intended to demonstrate nonlinearities
over  a  wide  range  of  capacitance 𝐶.  The  second  diagram,  on  the
contrary, aims to demonstrate the linear relationship between the two
voltages 𝐸𝑇𝐷 and 𝐸𝑉 𝑀 .  In  the  diagrams,  colors  specify  excitability
classes and excitation blocks; for classes 1 and 2, shades indicate the
width of the input current operating range (current interval length from
initial to peak spiking frequency on the corresponding f-I curve).

As can be seen from Figs. 10 and 11, the capacitance enlargement
leads to the loss of the excitability class 2. Higher peak currents 𝐼𝑝 of the
diodes expand class 2 excitability regions. The shifted peak 𝐼𝑝 position
of the GI401A diode correspondingly affects the operating range of the
voltage 𝐸𝑇𝐷. In general, the resulting diagrams are intended to guide
the operating modes during the development of a neuromorphic system
based on the proposed neuron circuit.

All results presented in this section were obtained via simulation
using the 4th order Runge–Kutta numerical integration method with
the fixed step-size ℎ =  5 ⋅ 10−8 s in 64-bit double data type on GPU
enabled with the Nvidia CUDA technology [51].

4.  Discussion

An  important  issue  is  the  energy  and  power  consumption  of  the
proposed artificial neuron. The easy-to-follow methodology of its es-
timation may be found in [32]. The average power dissipation of the
neuron at the charging phase, i.e. when membrane voltage rises, is:

𝑃𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝 =

1
𝑡𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝

∫
0

𝑡𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝

𝐼(𝑡)𝑉 (𝑡) 𝑑 𝑡

(7)

9

where 𝐼(𝑡) and 𝑉 (𝑡) are the consumed current and membrane voltage,
and 𝑡𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝 is the duration of the rising voltage phase of a spike. With
𝑉 (𝑡) represented as a triangular function, the following approximation
is relevant:
𝐼0

(𝑉𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 − 𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡

𝑃𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝 =

)

Power dissipation during the voltage descend phase of a spike may
be expressed through the ratio of 𝑅𝑜𝑛 and 𝑅𝑜𝑓 𝑓 values of a memristive
device, as during this phase the capacitor discharges, and current flows
through a device with a resistance of 𝑅𝑜𝑛, which leads to proportionally
less power dissipation. Thus, the overall power dissipation:
)

(

𝑃𝑛 =

𝑃𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝 𝑡𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝
𝑇𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑

1 +

𝑅𝑜𝑛
𝑅𝑜𝑓 𝑓

(9)

In  the  AND-TS  device,  the  ratio  of 𝑅𝑜𝑛 to 𝑅𝑜𝑓𝑓 tends  to  zero.
Using  values  obtained  during  simulation  in  Section Neuron  Features,
find: 𝑃𝑐 𝑙 𝑎𝑚𝑝 =  21  μA ⋅ 0.5 ⋅ (0.119 − 0.03) V  =  0.935  μW,  and 𝑃𝑛 =
0.935 μW (1.343 ms∕1.594 ms) = 0.788 μW.

Also, we may estimate the energy of a spike [26]:

𝐸𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑒 = 𝑉𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑒 ⋅ 𝐼𝑡ℎ ⋅ 𝑇𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑

(10)

Here, 𝐼𝑡ℎ represents the peak current flowing into the neuron cell.
For  the  proposed  neuron, 𝐸𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑒 =  0.119  V ⋅ 0.21  μA ⋅ 1.594  ms  =
3.98 nJ. The energy per spike depends on 𝑇𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑 and, accordingly, on
the capacitance 𝐶. With 𝐶 =  2.2 nF and 𝑉𝑇𝐷 =  0.06 V, we obtained
the  following  estimation: 𝐸𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑒 =  0.1  V ⋅ 0.21  μA ⋅ 75  μs  =  150  pJ,
while power estimation remained the same. The lower bound of the
energy per spike is limited exclusively by the AND-TS set and reset
speed of approximately 200 ns, as the tunnel diode is capable of GHz
range operation. For comparison, energy per spike in the human brain

is approximately 50 fJ, and the power consumption of one neuron or
synapse is 10 fW [32].

Another consideration may be taken by analytical energy estima-
tion, using the concept of the Hamilton energy [52–54], which repre-
sents the conservative part of full energy in dissipative neuron system.
The energy is stored by the capacitor and memristor in their state vari-
ables 𝑉 and 𝑋, accordingly, having their respective physical meaning.
The definition for Hamilton energy 𝐻 follows from Helmholtz theorem:
𝜕 𝐻
𝜕 𝑉𝐶
where 𝐾 is a conservative part of the equation. Taking into account
Eqs. (3) and (4), we obtain the following relation:
𝑑 𝑉𝑐
𝑑 𝐻

The full derivation of (12) may be found in Appendix C. The expression
(12) may be computed numerically along numeric simulation of the
neuron model, by using values of time derivatives 𝑑 𝑋∕𝑑 𝑡 and 𝑑 𝑉𝐶 ∕𝑑 𝑡
and  having  Hamilton  energy  as  an  additional  state  variable  of  the
neuron ODE. This approach enables adaptive energy regulation in the

neuron.

A comparison of different memristor-based neurons’ electric power
consumption is presented in Table 3. A limited number of models are
included in the table because power estimates are not available for all
of the referenced papers. One may see that, except model from [25], our
model consumes less power. Also, it is the only quasi-Hodgkin–Huxley
model among all presented.

The next notable point is that the spiking amplitudes of the pro-
posed artificial neuron are comparable to the amplitudes of biological
neurons of mammals, which are in the range of 50–120 mV [30]. This
makes the developed device naturally bio-compatible and applicable
to brain-to-computer and nervous system-prosthetic interface design.
